Prebuilt binaries for MESA. This allows this installer to run with software rendering in the case that hardware rendering is not supported.
All hashes match from [mesa3d-25.1.3-release-mingw.7z (x86)](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases/tag/25.1.3).

These files are not installed automatically, and are only here as a fallback. Its very uncommon hardware rendering isn't supported at all.
